## üéØ Executive Summary

**Texas Hold'em ZK Poker** is the world's first fully transparent, provably fair poker game built on **Hedera Hashgraph**, combining zero-knowledge proofs for card shuffling with Hedera's enterprise-grade distributed ledger technology. Players interact peer-to-peer with instant finality, cryptographically verified card dealing, and transparent stake settlement.

### The Problem We Solve

The $60+ billion online poker industry faces three critical issues:

1. **Trust Crisis**: Players must trust centralized platforms with shuffling and dealing
2. **Lack of Transparency**: Proprietary algorithms with no way to verify fairness
3. **High Fees & Slow Settlement**: 5-10% rake, delayed withdrawals, expensive payment processing

### Our Solution

A fully decentralized poker platform where:
- ‚úÖ **Card shuffling is cryptographically verifiable** using zero-knowledge proofs
- ‚úÖ **Every action is recorded on-chain** for complete transparency
- ‚úÖ **Players interact peer-to-peer** with instant finality (3-5 seconds)
- ‚úÖ **Fees are predictable and minimal** ($0.001 per transaction)
- ‚úÖ **Real-time gameplay** with sub-second updates via Hedera Consensus Service

---

## üöÄ Why Hedera? The Technical Edge

We chose Hedera Hashgraph over Ethereum, Solana, and other blockchains for five compelling reasons:

### 1. **Instant Finality** (3-5 seconds)
Traditional blockchains require multiple confirmations. Hedera provides absolute finality in seconds, crucial for real-time gaming where players expect instant responses.

**Impact:** Players don't wait 30-60 seconds for their bet to confirm. Game flow feels native.

### 2. **Predictable, Low-Cost Fees** ($0.001 per transaction)
Ethereum gas fees spike to $50-200 during congestion. Solana's fees are unpredictable. Hedera's fees are fixed and microscopic.

**Impact:** A complete poker hand (20-30 transactions) costs less than $0.03, making micro-stakes games economically viable.

### 3. **10,000+ Transactions Per Second**
Hedera handles 10,000+ TPS with horizontal scaling to millions. This supports:
- **100,000+ concurrent players**
- **10,000+ simultaneous tables**
- **Zero congestion** during peak hours

**Impact:** We can scale to PokerStars-level traffic (50M+ players) without performance degradation.

### 4. **Native Token Service (HTS)**
Creating tokens on Ethereum costs $1000+ in gas. On Hedera, it's $1. Token transfers are atomic and built into the protocol.

**Impact:**
- Instant rake distribution to stakeholders
- Tournament tokens (NFTs) at scale
- Loyalty rewards without blockchain bloat

### 5. **Consensus Service for Real-Time Updates (HCS)**
Hedera's HCS broadcasts game state updates to all players and spectators in **real-time** without polling smart contracts every second (which would cost thousands in gas on Ethereum).

**Impact:**
- Live spectating with 1-second latency
- Player chat with persistent history
- Global lobby updates without centralized servers

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture: Full Hedera Stack Integration

We leverage **four Hedera services**, showcasing a comprehensive multi-service integration:

### 1. **Hedera Smart Contract Service (HSCS)** ‚ö°

**Core Contracts:**
```
GameFactory.sol       - Create2 factory for deterministic game addresses
Game.sol              - Core poker game logic and state management
RevealVerifier.sol    - ZK proof verification for card reveals
TexasPoker.sol        - Hand ranking and evaluation library
DeckManager.sol       - Encrypted deck shuffling logic
```

**Why This Matters:**
- **EVM Compatibility**: Developers familiar with Solidity can build on our protocol
- **Composability**: Other dApps can integrate our poker engine
- **Upgradeability**: Factory pattern allows seamless protocol upgrades

**Deployed Contracts:**
- GameFactory: `0x8701aC94337A987957a6F0a74448Dbc6F67b0D58`

  gameId: "0x...",
  player: "0x...",
  action: "raise",
  amount: 100,
  timestamp: 1234567890
}
```

**Why This Matters:**
- **Cost Effective**: 1000 messages = $0.01 (vs $10,000 on Ethereum)
- **Persistent History**: All game actions permanently recorded, verifiable by auditors
- **No Centralized Servers**: Lobby and chat run entirely on Hedera
- **Spectator Mode**: Anyone can watch games in real-time

**Deployed Topics:**
- GAME_EVENTS: `0.0.7143266`

## üéÆ Gameplay Flow: 8-Stage Poker Protocol

The game follows a complete poker lifecycle from deck preparation to winner payout:

```
Shuffle ‚Üí Ante ‚Üí Pre-Flop ‚Üí Flop ‚Üí Turn ‚Üí River ‚Üí End (Choose Cards) ‚Üí Winner
```

### Stage 1: Shuffle üîÄ

All players must shuffle the deck using ZK proofs before betting begins.

**Mental Poker Protocol:**
1. **Player 1**: Generates masked deck + public key commitment + SNARK proof ‚Üí submits on-chain
2. **Players 2-N**: Fetch on-chain deck ‚Üí shuffle ‚Üí generate SNARK proof ‚Üí submit on-chain
3. **Verification**: All shuffles cryptographically verified on-chain
4. **Game Start**: Only begins when all players complete shuffling

**Cryptographic Guarantee:** Each shuffle is proven to be a valid permutation without revealing card order. An attacker would need to break 256-bit elliptic curve crypto (harder than breaking Bitcoin).

### Stages 2-6: Betting Rounds (5 Rounds) üí∞

Players bet in turns. Each round reveals different cards and requires action:

| Stage | Cards Revealed | Action Required |
|-------|---------------|-----------------|
| **1. Ante** | None | Initial pot contribution (real ETH) |
| **2. Pre-Flop** | 2 hole cards per player | Bet + Submit reveal tokens for opponents' cards |
| **3. Flop** | 3 community cards | Bet + Submit reveal tokens for community cards |
| **4. Turn** | 4th community card | Bet + Submit reveal tokens |
| **5. River** | 5th community card | Bet + Submit reveal tokens |

**Betting Mechanics:**
- ‚úÖ Players send **actual ETH** with bets (no IOU system)
- ‚úÖ Must match or raise current highest bet
- ‚úÖ Can fold to exit (forfeit stake)
- ‚úÖ 120-second timeout per action (automatic force-fold if exceeded)

**Card Reveal System:**
1. **Submit Reveal Tokens**: Click button to generate tokens for cards needing decryption
   - Uses your secret key + ZK cryptography
   - Tokens allow others to decrypt without exposing your key
   
2. **Auto-Decryption**: Once all players submit tokens, cards decrypt automatically
   - Refreshes every 2 seconds
   - No manual action needed after token submission
   
3. **Privacy Guarantee**:
   - Only you can decrypt your hole cards (until End round)
   - Community cards decrypt when all tokens submitted
   - ZK proofs ensure cryptographic integrity

### Stage 7: End Round (Strategic Choice) üÉè

**This is where strategy matters!**

After River betting completes, each player must:
1. **Choose 3 cards** from the 5 community cards
2. Submit choice on-chain via `chooseCards()` function

**Your Final Hand Structure:**
```
[Hole Card 1] [Hole Card 2] [Community Card] [Community Card] [Community Card]
     ‚Üë              ‚Üë              ‚Üë                ‚Üë                ‚Üë
  Fixed (auto)  (auto)        Your Choice    Your Choice    Your Choice
```

**Example:**
```
Your Hole: [A‚ô† K‚ô†]
Community: [Q‚ô† J‚ô† 10‚ô† 2‚ô¶ 7‚ô£]
            1   2   3   4  5

Best Choice: Pick cards 1, 2, 3
Final Hand: [A‚ô† K‚ô† Q‚ô† J‚ô† 10‚ô†] = Royal Flush! üèÜ
```

**Why This Mechanic?**
- More **strategic** than auto-selecting best hand
- Requires **poker knowledge** and hand evaluation skills
- Adds **skill-based gameplay** element
- Players leverage experience, not just luck

### Stage 8: Winner Determination & Payout üèÜ

After all players choose their cards:

1. **Hand Evaluation**: Contract evaluates each player's 5-card hand using `TexasPoker.sol`
2. **Weight Calculation**: Each hand gets a weight (Royal Flush = 9000+, High Card = 1000+)
3. **Winner Selection**: Highest weight wins
4. **Automatic Payout**: ETH transferred to winner immediately
5. **Backup Withdrawal**: `claimWinnings()` available if auto-transfer fails

**Hand Rankings:**
1. Royal Flush ‚Üí 9000+
2. Straight Flush ‚Üí 8000+
3. Four of a Kind ‚Üí 7000+
4. Full House ‚Üí 6000+
5. Flush ‚Üí 5000+
6. Straight ‚Üí 4000+
7. Three of a Kind ‚Üí 3000+
8. Two Pair ‚Üí 2000+
9. Pair ‚Üí 1000+
10. High Card ‚Üí 0-999

## üîê Security & Anti-Griefing

### ZK Proof System: Mental Poker Protocol

**What We Implemented:**
- Zypher Secret Engine for ZK proof generation
- Groth16 SNARKs for on-chain verification
- BN254 elliptic curve cryptography
- Client-side shuffle verification with on-chain reveal token validation

**Security Guarantee:**
Cryptographically impossible to cheat without breaking 256-bit elliptic curve crypto‚Äîmore expensive than NSA's entire budget.

### Anti-Griefing: Action Timeout

**Problem:** Players could stall the game indefinitely  
**Solution:** 120-second action timeout

- Each player has 2 minutes per action
- Timer resets after each valid action
- Any player can call `forceFold()` after timeout expires
- Timed-out player automatically folds and forfeits stake

### Smart Error Handling

Blockchain errors are translated to user-friendly messages. See error mappings in `apps/www/src/lib/utils.ts`.

### üíª MetaMask Integration

**Supported Wallet:** MetaMask (EVM-compatible via Hedera JSON-RPC)

**Network Configuration:**
```javascript
Network Name: Hedera Testnet
RPC URL: https://testnet.hashio.io/api
Chain ID: 296 (0x128)
Currency Symbol: HBAR
Block Explorer: https://hashscan.io/testnet
```

**Current Implementation:**
- ‚úÖ MetaMask connect via RainbowKit
- ‚úÖ EVM address support (0x...)
- ‚úÖ Transaction signing through MetaMask
- ‚úÖ Hedera testnet (Chain ID 296)
- ‚è≥ Native Hedera account linking (future)

**Why MetaMask Works:**
Hedera's JSON-RPC Relay allows Ethereum wallets like MetaMask to interact with Hedera as if it were an EVM chain, while still leveraging Hedera's native services (HTS, HCS) on the backend.
